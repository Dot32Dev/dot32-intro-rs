# Dot32 intro

The (work in progress) port of my love2d intro into rust. 

Hopefully, if i do this right, i could use cargo to import the intro in instead of copy pasting the thing every time (which after i tweaked an intro would leave me with many different versions of it and in different places i needed to paste the new one into)
