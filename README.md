# Dot32 intro

The (work in progress) port of my love2d intro into rust. Hopefully, if i do this right, i could use cargo to port it in instead of copy pasting the thing every time (which after i tweaked an intro would leave me with many different versions of it and places i needed to paste the new one into)
